            <h1>61.9 kmpl in BMW!!!!!!</h1>

            <p style="padding: 20px;">I’d like to believe the past few years have seen the boffins at BMW’s headquarters
                in Munich, Germany,
                take it upon themselves to do things differently. Probably, right from the way they make their coffee to
                the way they have it. Because it’s only twice in its history that BMW has had its motorsport division or
                BMW M break tradition and create an all-new model on its own. The first was the BMW M1, launched way
                back in 1978, and the second is the all-new BMW XM here. BMW’s M division is usually known for making
                go-faster BMWs, but the XM is the most special offering to wear the BMW roundel yet. Besides being only
                the second car ever to be developed by the M division, it is also the first plugin hybrid M car, the
                most powerful M car ever and no prizes for guessing, BMW’s new flagship SUV.
